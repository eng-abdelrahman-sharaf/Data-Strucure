## AVL vs. BST Visualization ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ

This project implements two binary search tree (BST) data structures: a standard BST and a self-balancing AVL tree. The project utilizes Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that visually demonstrates the differences in insertion between the two trees.
