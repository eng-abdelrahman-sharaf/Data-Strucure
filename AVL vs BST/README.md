# Getting Started with AVL vs BST visualization

## 1. Installing Python

- Before you can run the project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Simply click the link, and follow the instructions to install Python on your system. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system PATH during the installation process.

## 2. Downloading the Project Repository

- Next, you'll need to download the project files from GitHub. Here's how:
  1. Go to the project's GitHub page by clicking [this link](https://github.com/eng-abdelrahman-sharaf/Data-Strucure/tree/main/AVL%20vs%20BST).
  2. On the GitHub page, click on the green "Code" button near the top right corner.
  3. From the dropdown menu, select "Download ZIP". This will download the project files as a ZIP archive to your computer.
  4. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer and extract its contents to a folder of your choice.

## 3. Running the Project

- Now that you have the project files extracted, you can run the main Python script to start the project. Here's how:
  1. Open the folder where you extracted the project files.
  2. Inside the folder, you should see a file named `main.py`. This is the main Python script for the project.
  3. To run the script, simply double-click on the `main.py` file. Alternatively, you can open a command prompt or terminal window, navigate to the folder containing `main.py`, and run the following command:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

  4. The project should now start running, and you should see two windows one contains an AVL Tree and the other contains a BST Tree.

That's it! You've successfully installed and run the project.
